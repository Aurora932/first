# x735-script
This is script installation tutorial for `X735 v2.5 & v3.0`, and this guideline is similar to [XScript](https://github.com/geekworm-com/xscript) only because the hardware uses a different GPIO.
***
The original pwm fan control script is from [pimlie/geekworm-x-c1](https://github.com/pimlie/geekworm-x-c1), **pimlie** implements the pwm fan shell script, which does not depend on third-party python libraries at all. Thanks to **pimlie**.
